							We started with a dream. A dream for our sugar barons, migrants, sugar peasants, and unheard
							minorities.
						</p>
						<p>
							On December 2018, the Institute was registered under the National Youth Commission’s
							Youth
							Organization Registration Program (YORP) as a community-based youth organization., following
							the
							support and vision of young leaders from the Negrosanon Young Leaders Summit that started in
							2017.
						</p>
						<p>
							On February 2019, Negrosanon Young Leaders Institute Incorporated was formally registered
							with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-stock, non-profit organization.
						</p>
						<p>
							On 2020, NYLI Inc. has been registered and licensed with the Department of Social
							Welfare and
							Development as a community-based social welfare agency, and in the same year, NYLI Inc
							received
							support from the <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/consuelozobelalgerfoundation/"
									style="text-decoration:none; color:#006443;">Consuelo
									Zobel Alger Foundation</a></b> that became instrumental to its growth and
							development as an organization.
						</p>
						<p>
							On November 2021, the <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NegOcc.Gov"
									style="text-decoration:none; color:#006443;">Provincial Government of Negros
									Occidental</a></b> through the Local
							Youth
							Development Council and the Provincial SK Federation, the Institute has been granted with
							the
							deed of
							usufructuary rights for the Hulot sang Pamatanon and Safe Space for our young people to
							collaborate
							and for our humble dreams to expand.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, NYLI has opened more programs for the welfare of the youth of the province, the
							region,
							and the nation with support from Consuelo Zobel Alger Foundation, and other funding partners
							who
							believes in the power of young people to make a difference. We have hosted 6 batches of
							young
							leaders
							fellowship all across the province.
						</p>
						<p>
							We are here because we first believed. We are here because we never stopped trying, and you
							never
							stopped believing.
						</p>
						<p>
							NYLI Inc. continues to live on, carry on, and pass on to the youth the greatness of the
							Negrosanon people and responsibility to co-create a future for a sustainable Negros and the
							Philippines.

						<p>Integrity
						In our youth development programs, we prioritize modeling and promoting integrity in our interactions while providing opportunities for young people to develop their leadership skills through activities that promote honesty, fairness, and responsibility. Our goal is to foster a culture of integrity that helps young people become ethical and effective leaders who positively impact their communities.
						</p>

						<p>Accountability
						We prioritize accountability in our youth-centered and community social accountability approach as we believe it is critical to building trust and credibility with the communities we serve. Therefore, we create a culture that promotes responsible and ethical behavior, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among young people and community members.
						</p>

						<p>Empowerment
						Empowerment is a core value that guides our work with youth in vulnerable and disadvantaged situations. We believe in providing them with the tools and resources they need to create a better future for themselves and their communities.
						</p>

						<p>Inclusiveness
						We prioritize a proactive approach that encourages meaningful participation from children and youth in our efforts to create an inclusive environment that recognizes and values their diverse needs and perspectives. We believe that by providing equal opportunities and resources, we can empower young people to succeed and make meaningful contributions to their communities.
						</p>

						<p>Nurturance
						We anchor our value of nurturance for children and youth in the Positive Youth Development (PYD) framework, which emphasizes the importance of fostering supportive relationships, environments, and experiences to promote youth's positive development. We prioritize creating a nurturing environment that supports the well-being and positive development of young people, and promotes community building through meaningful connections and relationships.
						</p>

						<p>Purposive
						Purposive is a core value that guides our work, emphasizing a solutions-focused approach that is community-centered. We prioritize designing interventions that are intentional and goal-oriented, rooted in community needs and strengths, and that foster collaboration and collective action to achieve positive change.
						</p>

						<p>People centered
						People-centered is a core value that emphasizes the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, and their interdependence with one another. We prioritize designing and implementing programs and interventions that respect and promote the inherent rights of people, and that foster an inclusive and equitable environment where everyone is valued, respected, and supported to reach their full potential.
						</p>

						<p>Sustainability
						Sustainability is a core value that guides our programming and decision-making processes in the organization. We are taking a holistic approach to child and youth development and we are promoting initiatives and programs that will provide long-term impacts to the lives of children and youth. We are also striving to incorporate sustainable practices into the day-to-day operations of the organization, and that we do no harm, either to people or the environment. Ultimately, it reflects our commitment to creating a safer and better world for children and young people to inherit.
