				<h3 class="tagline">Exploitation is not a gratification.</h3>
				<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported that during the
					COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate in the country rose from 8.1% or 3.88 million Filipinos to
					8.9% or 4.25 million Filipinos from November 2021 to September that year. Shifting to remote working
					due to the <br>
					nationwide lockdown caused multiple shocks including disruptions in education and training,
					employment and earnings, and increased job search constraints for vulnerable people like the youth
					and informal workers. More and more companies have turned to overly exploit them, particularly in
					our country, capitalizing on the vulnerable people’s naivety and unfortunate circumstances.<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Some foreign companies that employ Filipino job seekers for business processing outsourcing (BPO)
					work offer low pay that is below the minimum wage and refuse to provide the same benefits as their
					domestic workers. Sick pay is entitled to permanent employees, but many have had their contracts
					altered to floating status. Those who are unable to work are regarded as disposable and are not
					supported financially. Those who can work are put in hazardous situations, without taking the
					necessary precautions.
